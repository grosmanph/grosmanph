### Hey there, I'm Pedro Grosman.

Due to my solid academic background and professional experience, I'm mostly into any R&D subject.

Currently, I'm working on developing data-driven solutions for any kind of business interested in using data to empower any decision-making process. As a data scientist, my main goal is to develop high-performance data-fed applications to optimize time-consuming tasks, make decision-making scalable, maximize profits, reduce mistakes, and much more.
